#trapped- supposed to be trapped in invisable maze
#godot

# WASD to move
#its broken so i have no clue
#supposed to be a invisble maze but life hates me
#pt 2- added animation, fixed it, found errors failed at fixing it and added background, didn't work
#couldn't add feature since i never finished
#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Luf2Kr5s3BM tutorial i used
#bugs- the animtaion glitches when running more than a second, background pixcels are too small, and it lets me move off background onto gray area
#it wont work now cause characterbody2d isnt working with node2d??
